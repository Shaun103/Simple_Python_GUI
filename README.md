The class BankAccount class will hold all banking attributes (first name, last name..ect)
GUI class object will display/manipulate the BankAccount attributes

The program is an update from a previous 
Python project https://github.com/Shaun103/Python_Bank_Class/blob/master/python_bank_account.py
this project no longer uses the command line in order to gather and display information. 

In order for the program to run the user must choose a standard account. 
To do this, a button can be found titled "Account Type" that is found in the top left of the program screen
At the moment there is only one option titled "Standard"

In the future I will add different accounts, such as interest, trust ect..
