I created this program so that I can better
understand tkinter and manipulating class variables
and understanding a gui system better

The class bank account class will hold all banking attributes (first name last name..ect)
while the  GUI class will display and manipulate the account object attributes

The program will work with a gui instead of a command line 
in order to gather and display information. 

The gui banking system is better way of manipulating class objects than the command line

In order for the program to run the user must choose a standard account. 
This is found in the top left of the program screen

In the future I would like to add different accounts, such as interest, trust ect..
